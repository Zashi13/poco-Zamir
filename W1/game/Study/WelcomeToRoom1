You enter a small room with wood-panneld walls and one small window a top left corner. The sunlight reflects in the dusty air to create Beautiful lightrais that perfectly frame a large portrait on the opposite wall. On the wall apposite to you, you see an old man hunched over a big wooden desk. He does not seem to notice you. Should you talk to him?

On your left you spot a large book propped open on an ancient reading deskt. The yelowing pages contain curious simbold and text of an unknown language. Should you take a look?
